<h1> Notes To Readers 

<p><h3> to whoever is checking out the granum, I created granum as a collection of my entire journey in the world of programming. </p>

<p> The name granum is a term used in biology that contains light harvesting system. it's purpose is to speed up the process as to speed up the process of photosynthesis, it is a figurative name that all my work is simply a speed up proccess on my journey to learn coding.</p>

<p>I believe that encouraging failure and mistakes done and finding ways to debug codes is what makes a coder more resilient into giving up</p>

<p> nonetheless, this is more akin to a journal of my prgoress. do enjoy your visit to mmy granum. </p>
