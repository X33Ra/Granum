<h1> Agenda of Granum <h1>

1. Showcase code
2. A back log incase of a problem
3. A trash bin filled with failed materials
4. A collection of my coding journey

<h1> Notes To Readers 

<p><h3> to whoever is checking out the granum, I created granum as a collection of my entire journey in the world of programming. </p>

<p> The name granum is a term used in biology that contains light harvesting system. it's purpose is to speed up the process as to speed up the process of photosynthesis, it is a figurative name that all my work is simply a speed up proccess on my journey to learn coding.</p>

<p>I believe that encouraging failure and mistakes done and finding ways to debug codes is what makes a coder more resilient into giving up</p>

<p> nonetheless, this is more akin to a journal of my prgoress. do enjoy your visit to my granum. </p>

<p>If you notice that some of my commits are either useless or seems to be coming from somewhere do note I was either raging cause the code was so annoying and took me so long to figure out I placed them in wrong order, Or just some minor problems I ended up turning it into a lord of the ring battlefield also do note I code most of the time at night my brain goes UWU on me just like right now as im editing this readme.
