  3. Edit out the "name" to @username/[Folder Name]
    > For example: @kvirani/lotide.
  4. Specify valid "description" and "author" fields.

      > "keywords": []
      > "author": "@UserName",
      > "license": "ISC",
      > "bugs": {
      >   "url": "https://github.com/@UserName/Folder Name/issues"
